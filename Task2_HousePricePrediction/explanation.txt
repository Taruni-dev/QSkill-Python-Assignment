Task 2: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

In this task, a house price dataset was used to build a predictive model.
Numerical features such as area, number of rooms, and bathrooms were selected.

Missing values were handled using mean substitution.
The dataset was split into training and testing sets.

A Linear Regression model was trained and evaluated using the R2 score.
The scatter plot between actual and predicted prices shows the model performance.

Conclusion:
The model can successfully predict house prices based on input features.
