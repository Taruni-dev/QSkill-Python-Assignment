Task 1: Data Analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib

In this task, a CSV dataset was loaded using the Pandas library.
Basic data exploration was performed using head(), info(), and describe().

The average of a numerical column was calculated to understand data distribution.

Visualizations such as bar chart, scatter plot, and heatmap were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
These graphs help in understanding patterns, trends, and correlations in the dataset.

Observations:
- The dataset shows meaningful distribution in numerical values.
- Heatmap indicates correlation between numeric features.
- Visualization helps in quick decision making.
